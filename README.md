3. My definition of Big Data would be massive datasets that can be used to make decisions and developments for the society.



## Lab Questions

1. On Github we can code by ourselves and also collaborate with others. During the collaboration, we can know and see the changes made by others and vice versa by getting notifications. Also, we can ask questions and report errors. If others see my comments, they could help me with the problem or find another person who is more good at it. If we or other people create a new feature or develop a new way to solve problems, the solution or feature can be shared with others to use. In addition, GitHub has a function called "pull requests" People can send requests in order to discuss with or ask questions to teammates. Other teammates can make a copy of the code and make changes or improvements without accidentally deleting others' work. Each member has her own copy of the code. When we finish with the changes, we can merge the code and then everyone can see and use the new code. Although during our projects, we only allow certain people to edit the documents, if our work becomes public later, other people around the world could also see or use our work to help with their work. The requests or changes can be noticed by our team members so that everyone can get updated on the work.

2. Pull request lets us show what we have there and lets other people discuss in order to see if it is good or needs some improvements. Clone means that when other people in your team want to make some changes in your code, they should make a copy in order to change the code safely without deleting your other works.

3. GoDaddy - Microbusiness Density Forecasting from Kaggle
("https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e3/code"). The dataset was generated synthetically from a deep machine learning model based on employee attrition situation in a company. Use Python to predict and help micro-business companies grow, and help governments make policies to support these microbusiness companies. Also, perform EDA to forecast further employee attrition in order to find solutions.

4. Forecasting: Principles and Practice - Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos ("https://otexts.com/fpp2/"). Forecast or prediction plays a very important role in data analytics. We need forecasting to know the trends in the future, and some changes that are happening in society or in the market so that we can make better decisions.
